On Kali Execute:
"./05-tcp-proxy.py 0.0.0.0 21 <remote_ftp_server> <remote_ftp_port> True
  - You should now see the message
    - "[*] Listening on 0.0.0.0:21"

On your local host, open an FTP Client (i.e. FileZilla)
- connect to your Kali machine on port 21, remember to specify a username
  and password

Kali will receive the connection, and forward it to your targetted
remote ftp server. Connection will terminate after login.
